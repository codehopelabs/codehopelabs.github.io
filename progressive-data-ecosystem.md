The following is a [diagram of the progressive data ecosystem](https://lucid.app/documents/view/4e7aa70e-b207-4b70-b974-4a5ef4dd62b3):

<div style="width: 640px; height: 480px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:640px; height:480px" src="https://lucid.app/documents/embedded/4e7aa70e-b207-4b70-b974-4a5ef4dd62b3" id="G6coBfwMatZ8"></iframe></div>

The intention of this diagram is to differentiate major categories of software and databases from one another, and to indicate how they interrelate. It is not meant to list every vendor or system exhaustively. Higher Ground Labs maintains a [landscape report](https://highergroundlabs.com/political-tech-landscape-2021/) which is a much more comprehensive look at the progressive tech industry as a whole.

The above was inspired by a discussion of the [Progressive Action Database on Great Battlefield](http://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1133) (at about the 9:30 mark.)

This diagram is a work in progress! Feel free to [contact us](https://forms.gle/Mhy9LnGtPC9Pf2RR9) for access to edit or revise it.
