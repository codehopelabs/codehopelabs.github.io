title: Infrastructure endowment
description: Some elements of the progressive movement are "infrastructural" in nature and require ongoing operational funding. Would it be possible to gather some amount of capital to invest in some kind of endowment which could generate dividends to provide baseline support in some kind of "secular" fashion? Which organization should house such a fund, and how would it be raised without sacrificing short-term goals?
