title: Corporate fundraising
---

Corporate fundraising for progressive tech firms is difficult for at least three reasons: a. partisanship is confusing to potential fundraisers, who imagine that the firm is ceding half the market (i.e., by not soliciting conservative clients); b. cyclicality makes it difficult to measure growth and sustain the enterprise; c. some funders are not mission-aligned and/or actively wish to support conservative causes. Great discussion of this problem in the [Great Battlefield interview of Jeremy Smith](https://resistancedashboard.com/node/1090), around 8:46.
