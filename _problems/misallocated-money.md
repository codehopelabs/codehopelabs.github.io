title: Misallocated money
description: Donations tend to pour toward campaigns which grab the most headlines - especially in the case of candidates who oppose high-profile "bogeymen" on the right. However, in some cases these candidates are highly unlikely to win their races, and the money might have been deployed to more "winnable" elections.
