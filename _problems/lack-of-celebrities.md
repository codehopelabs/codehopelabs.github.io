title: Lack of celebrities
---

There are relatively few "celebrities" in progressive politics, setting aside elected officials. There are fewer still who are "non-legacy," i.e. native to digital media, as [Yashar Ali pointed out in July 2022](https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1548760754496540672). Tara McGowan describes a similar kind of problem in her [Great Battlefield episode](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1096) at around 44:24.
