Our ladder of engagement is fairly narrow and not sophisticated enough to engage supporters in the best way possible. For example, as David Slifka discusses in his Great Battlefield interview at the 51:45 mark, [progressives don't attempt to turn donors into donor organizers](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1113). Relatedly, in field organizing, supporters tend to get herded into voter contact, even if these activities do not match their skills best. There are a handful of carve-outs for specific skills - some campaigns seek lawyers who can assist with voter protection work for instance. But these attempts are limited; there is no substantial effort to marshal skills like software engineering, design and creative skills, and so forth, to benefit the campaign in general. This problem is understandable to the degree that campaigns often lack the time to marshal these skills well; and moreover, the need for voter contact work is substantially larger than the need for other types of work. However in the aggregate, this problem means that many highly-skilled supporters lack suitable engagement in the progressive movement at large.
