title: Digital as fundraising
---

We tend to shoehorn digit organizing into a fundraising function - i.e., email lists and SMS lists are used almost entirely to raise money. That means that we are underutilizing these tools, as they could be used for persuasion and mobilization, and even candidate recruitment instead. This problem is starting to mitigate somewhat - for example, [Snapchat's collaboration with RunForSomething](https://newsroom.snap.com/run-for-office) is an exciting approach to candidate recruitment - but more needs to be done. In some ways this problem boils down to attitudes among senior staff, as well as metrics to better measure the impact of non-fundraising digital efforts.
