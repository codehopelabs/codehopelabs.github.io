Democratic campaign staff tend to be low-paid and in some cases poorly-treated, especially with respect to their Republican counterparts. Similar problems are found in every corner of the progressive movement, including progressive tech firms (which tend to pay better than campaigns but not as well as other tech firms.) These problems can spill over into morale and staff churn, which in turn hamper the effectiveness of the movement overall. There are two encouraging trends in this area: a) an emerging cultural norm within the movement to post salary ranges in job postings and b) a wave of staff unionization efforts, especially in the proggressive tech sector.
