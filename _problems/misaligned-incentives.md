One of the most important incentive structures in Democratic politics is around ad placement. Consultants usually get paid a percentage of their ad placement, which in turn incentivizes them to encourage the campaign to place more and more ads, even if that is not the best way to win the campaign. In Republican politics, consultants are generally incentivized with win bonuses, which helps better align their incentives with the campaign's. (On the flip side, it may discourage consultants from working with races which are more difficult to win, thereby starving marginal races of useful talent.)
