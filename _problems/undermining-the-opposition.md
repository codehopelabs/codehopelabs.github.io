title: Undermining the opposition

Conservative policy has, as one of its main goals, the unraveling of the progressive coalition. Hence, conservative policy agendas tend to focus on minimizing unionization, tort reform which undermines trial lawyers, voting restrictions which tend to disproportionately impact marginalized communities, and so forth. Progressive policy proposals do not, as a general rule, seek to undermine the conservative coalition in quite the same way. While going too far in this direction can produce a very corrupt style of governance, it's clear that there are some reforms progressives could undertake - such as trade association reform, or corporate governance reform - which could likewise disrupt the conservative coalition.
