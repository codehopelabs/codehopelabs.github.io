title: Message coordination
---

Progressives lack effective means of message coordination, especially around key policy initiatives. It's difficult to measure message coordination, but relatively easy to see that conservatives coordinate better. Progressives lack a "messaging central," as [J Toscano discusses in his Great Battlefield interview](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/989) at the 52:10 mark. In particular, there is no long-term plan for communicating a policy agenda. There have been attempts to resolve this problem on the progressive side, by creating "war rooms" for particular policy proposals, but by and large these have faltered.
