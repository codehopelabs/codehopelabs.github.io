title: Insufficient organizing
---

Most of the money in progressive organizing is focused on swing states and key races in a handful of months before Election Day. What's more, a lot of this organizing is too narrow and fails to mobilize key elements of the base - especially marginalized communities. (In part that is because of the problem with biased models.) Finally, we tend to ignore constituencies and jurisdictions that don't support us - such as senior citizens and rural areas. However, doing so means we leave potential allies unmobilized, since we often have common cause with people in these constituencies and jurisdictions. We need to organize year-round, across a broader range of geographies, and across a wider swath of the population.
