title: Insufficient organizing
description: Most of the money in progressive organizing is focused on swing states and key races in a handful of months before Election Day. What's more, a lot of this organizing is too narrow and fails to mobilize key elements of the base - especially marginalized communities. (In part that is because of the problem with biased models.) We need to organize year-round, across a broader range of geographies, and across a wider swath of the population.
