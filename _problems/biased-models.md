title: Biased models
description: Models which guide campaign resource allocations, such as partisanship or vote propensity models, may tend to under-represent minorities, young people, and other marginalized people. When they do, they tend to push campaigns away from reaching such people. As a consequence, these communities can feel un-appreciated and may not turn out or engage as much as they otherwise might have; worse still, their needs are not well-represented in government. Benjamin Oh wrote about this problem in [Campaigns and Elections](https://campaignsandelections.com/campaigntech/to-keep-pace-with-a-more-diverse-electorate-progressives-need-to-up-their-data-game/) in Sept 2022.
