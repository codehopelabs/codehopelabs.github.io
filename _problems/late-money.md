title: Late money
---

A high proportion of donations to electoral campaigns tends to arrive toward the end of an election season, between September and November. By that time, it's usually too late to deploy resources effectively and efficiently - for instance, ad space on TV is cheapest when bought far in advance. This problem also impacts sales cycles in progressive tech, since clients tend to have limited funds until late in the cycle, when they are unable to make sound technology choices.
