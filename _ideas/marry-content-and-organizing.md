title: Marry content and organizing
---

This idea is a high-level approach to addressing an audience: incorporate political messaging and activity into a larger stream of "conventional" messaging and activity. Put another way, this approach attempts to bring politics into non-political venues.

It's not a new approach by any means, but it is largely under-represented among progressive technology startups. [HeadCount](https://www.headcount.org/about-headcount/) is one counter-example - it seeks to register voters at concerts and festivals. [Courier Newsroom](https://couriernewsroom.com/) follows this idea in its editorial decision, blending left-leaning news with largely apolitical news like sports and entertainment. Tara McGowan describes their approach to organizing in this [Great Battlefield episode](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1096), at around 52:54. [PushBlack](https://pushblack.org/) follows this approach but with a different kind of content.

Related to this approach is a somewhat different approach to delivering media, using social media-native formats. That is, this approach to media delivery designs content around a social media platform, rather than posting content on an independent website and merely linking to it from social media.
