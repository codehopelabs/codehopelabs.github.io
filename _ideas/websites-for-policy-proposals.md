Most of our digital organizing focuses on candidates and organizations; by contrast, we don't do much about digital organizing around policy proposals. For example, a simple survey for keywords like "green new deal," "student loan forgiveness," and "medicare for all" shows that only the last policy has a dedicated website. These are all fairly well-known policy proposals, yet there is no place for someone who supports these ideas to find a place to get involved. Perhaps relatedly, these proposals tend to be housed in a legislative office, rather than an outside organization. Creating dedicated organizations whose sole mission is to push these policy proposals forward would help to centralize digital organizing around them.
