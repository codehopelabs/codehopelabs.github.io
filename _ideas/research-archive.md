Modern campaigns need access to a trove of videos, sound clips, and speeches - together with transcripts - of their candidate and their opponents' appearances. Such an archive is invaluable for opposition research, rapid response, and related activities.

This idea is described at a high level by Matt Hodges in [this post](https://mastodon.social/@MattHodges/109761580797538792), based loosely on the Biden campaign's research archive, called ["CouchPotato"](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/biden-presidential-campaign/). Brett O'Donnell also mentions this idea in [his Business of Politics interview](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/10029954-do-debates-still-matter-brett-o-donnell-o-donnell-associates), at 25:21.
