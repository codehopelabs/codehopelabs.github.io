title: Big IMing
---

We do not have a ready approach to messaging over social media at scale. While we can deploy social media ads at scale with some ease, it is difficult to conduct what are essentially social media canvassing efforts. As a general rule social media companies seek to prevent that work through their API, precisely because it undercuts their advertising offerings. That is a problem, because social media IMs are in some sense a very natural way to reach some voters, especially if they're alreayd spending a lot of time on those platforms.
