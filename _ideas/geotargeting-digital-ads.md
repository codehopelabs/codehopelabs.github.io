title: Geotargeting digital ads
---

Politics is inherently a geographical activity - as Tip O'Neil famously said, all politics is local. Digital ad platforms, and especially mobile ad platforms, make it possible to geotarget constituents in a dynamic way which was not readily possible previously. For example, in his Business of Politics interview, Andy Yates describes an approach for [targeting voters waiting in line at a polling place on Election Day](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/11522419-bringing-digital-advertising-into-reach-for-campaigns-of-all-sizes-andy-yates-republican-ads) (13:39 mark). There are doubtless other advertising innovations possible in other contexts, e.g. for promoting rallies or for rapid response to breaking local news. Progressive tech entreprenuers should experiment with these ideas to fully leverage these capabilities.
