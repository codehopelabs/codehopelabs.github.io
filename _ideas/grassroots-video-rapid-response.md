title: Grassroots Video Rapid Response
---

Occasionally, lightning strikes during a campaign, especially in the closing weeks. Something noteworthy happens and there's a whirlwind of attention and news coverage. In these cases, it's ideal to be able to respond quickly and to capitalize on these situations. User-generated content, especially grassroots video featuring individuals' own stories, can be especially powerful in ads and other response formats. A toolset which supports this kind of work would be easy to bootstrap (using a combination of cell phones and Youtube) and could work wonders for rapid response.

J Toscano discusses a situation similar to the above on his [Great Battlefield interview](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/989), at about 32:26. In that particular case, he was working with VoteVets when Donald Trump's incendiary comments about fallen veterans made headlines.
