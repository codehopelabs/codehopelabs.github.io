Progressives should build a booking agency for podcasts, mimicking what already exists for traditional media.

Such an agency would assist podcast hosts in booking guests, and would also seek to promote guests who want to promote a particular idea - including, for example, authors with newly-released books, legislators and activists promoting a bill or a cause, etc. It could also assist podcast hosts with cross-promoting their work, for example by appearing on one another's shows.

Such an agency could be beneficial for podcasters looking to add new content to their shows, as well as guests looking to promote their ideas, and could help to "increase the volume" on progressive ideas writ large. The agency might have business model challenges, given the relatively limited amount of money available in independent podcasting.
