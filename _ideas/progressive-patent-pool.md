title: Progressive patent pool
---

Would it be possible to create a pool of patents on progressive technology, in order to protectively license our tools so that conservatives can't use them? Could such a pool be inadvertantly used to stifle progress?

This conversation arose out of an episode in 2019, when [VoterCircle patented its software](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=Votercircle&s2=Databases&OS=Votercircle+AND+Databases&RS=Votercircle+AND+Databases) and some in the progressive space grew concerned that the patent might be used against them. In a Great Battlefield podcast, [Sangeeth Peruri](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/620) explained that the patent would instead be used only to ensure that such technology could not be used by conservatives. There was some subsequent interest increating a "pool" for the progressive space, but it's unclear where this effort went or if it was in fact abandoned. Would it be a good idea, or is it right to leave it alone?
