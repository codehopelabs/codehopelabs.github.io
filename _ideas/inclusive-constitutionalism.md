title: Inclusive constitutionalism
---

This idea is a novel [framework for progressive constitutional interpretation](https://newrepublic.com/article/168447/14th-amendment-inclusive-supreme-court) published by Prof. Madiba Dennie in the New Republic. It acts as a positive alternative to the conservative framework of originalism. Many legal commentators have noted that originalism, for all its flaws, is coherent and easily understood by the public. Progressives have no meaningful response to this framework, and arguably this failure to respond is partially responsible for conservative ascendancy in the judiciary. Prof. Dennie's proposal, were it to gain sufficient support, could help to reverse this trend.
