There are numerous ways to visualize and analyze campaign fundraising, such as [OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/). But there are comparatively fewer ways to analyze spending by political committees. Spending data is very helpful, though - it can help illuminate a committee's activities, and thereby give opponents a window into that committee's strategies. One example of a spend tracker is [527 Tracker](https://527tracker.com/), which specifically tracks the spending of federal Super PACs and cross-references it with commercial data sets like TV spending; [Stephen Aaron discussed the project on Business of Politics](https://www.businessofpoliticspodcast.com/episode/money-talks-if-you-know-how-to-listen-stephen-aaron-527-tracker) in Oct 2022. While this project is useful in its own right, there are many extensions possible - for example, analyzing spending in state-level races.
