Cross-canvassing is a tactic to increase voter response rates to a field program. The idea is to combine multiple modes of contact to a single voter at different points in time. For example, a text messaging program could send a voter a text such as: "Sarah will be in your neighborhood in an hour; why don't you ask her about Senator X's position on Y issue?" Likewise, a postcarding program could follow up on promising phone bank contacts a few days after the initial phone conversation.
