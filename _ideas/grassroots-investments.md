Sites like Mainvest and Republic Funds use new SEC rules to allow very small-dollar investments towards profitable enterprises. While groups like Republic do sometimes use these investment avenues towards social progress enterprises, there is no real focus on progressive tech in this space. At the same time, there is certainly a culture of small-dollar giving in the progressive movement. Can this culture be used to fund investments in progressive tech? Could sites like ActBlue even be repurposed towards such causes with relative ease?

One important experiment in this area is Unified, a social media app for activists which has had a very successful [small-dollar investment program](https://wefunder.com/unified/) to date. (I have promoted and invested in this program myself -Shai Sachs.)
