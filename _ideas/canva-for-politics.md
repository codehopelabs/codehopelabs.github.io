[Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is a very popular design tool that's well-known for democratizing graphic assets. That is, it makes it easier for lay people with limited graphic design skills to create graphical assets like slideshows.

In his Business of Politics interview, near the 31:04 mark, [Andy Yates](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/11522419-bringing-digital-advertising-into-reach-for-campaigns-of-all-sizes-andy-yates-republican-ads) suggested that there's a need for a "Canva for politics" - that is, a tool that can democratize the creation of graphical assets, especially digital ads, in a political context. This idea has some precedents - for example, [Speakeasy Political](https://www.speakeasypolitical.com/) has a design tool and templates to make it easy for candidates to create political mailers. There may well be similar tools in other contexts.

A general-purpose design tool, especially one which encourages campaigns to try unconvential design formats, might well be transformative in the way campaigns approach digital advertising and social media.
