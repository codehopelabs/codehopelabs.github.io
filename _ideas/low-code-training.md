Just as there are training programs in digital organizing and data management, progressives should organize a series of low-code trainings for political operatives, to encourage the use of low-code tools in campaigns and other time-strapped organizations. Such courses would cover topics like Excel macros, Zapier, Airtable, iPhone and Android app builders, Streamlit, and similar tools. They could be housed in a variety of organizations, such as the DCCC (for its Red to Blue candidates), the Arena (for a broader segment of operatives), or as a standalone organization. Such trainings could be funded by a [startup incubator](https://codehopelabs.com/ideas/startup-incubator.html), which could benefit from the creation of temporary low-code tools by incubating startups that productionize such tools for longer-term adoption.

Low code tools are already in wide use in political organizations, but the full potential of these tools has yet to be unlocked. Some examples of low-code tool usage in political organizations include:

* Custom workflows for welcoming new supporters, as [Daisychain](https://www.daisychain.app/) supports
* Capturing data on-the-go which can't be captured by tools like MiniVAN
* Scanning person-specific QR codes in a mobile app to eliminate data entry errors
* In-house tools for user management
* Custom list-building
* [Managing a custom fundraising database across multiple clients](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1145), as Kalani Tissot describes in his Great Battlefield interview at the 43:20 mark.

Ryan Rogers also discusses the use of [app builders which target the political space specifically](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/10910445-what-it-takes-to-build-a-winning-campaign-website-ryan-rodgers-the-strategy-group-co) in his Business of Politics interview, at the 30 minute mark - but it's unclear how such a builder would differ substantially from other app-building tools.
