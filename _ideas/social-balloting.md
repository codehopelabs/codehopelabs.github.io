title: Social balloting
---

Social balloting is a B2C app that makes it easy for endorsers (whether organizations, celebrities, or everyday voters) to share their endorsements with others at scale. One way to do so is for voters to prepare their sample ballots and to share them via social media. Another is to collect endorsements in a database that can be accessed by API. Aviva Rosman discusses this latter idea, as a potential extension to the core database maintained by BallotReady, in [her Great Battlefield interview](http://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1080), at 24:04.
