title: Startup incubator
---

While there is already a vibrant culture of innovation in progressive tech, we have arguably only scratched the surface; there are still numerous problems to attack. At the same time the ecosystem suffers from a lack of higher-level planning - we do not sufficiently architect solutions that we know will be needed well in advance.

There are numerous patterns in the broader software industry for solving this kind of problem, including industrial research labs, venture studios, and startup incubators. Can we create a startup incubator that would bring structure to the ecosystem, while lowering the bar to entry?

That effort ultimately failed - is it possible to revive it with a different business model? Similar themes of incubation appeared in the following interviews:
