title: Staff sharing
---

Many organizations have a need for some specialized function (e.g., bookkeeping), but can't afford a full-time staff person for that role. In cases where contracting out the work is not possible, they can instead turn to "staff-sharing" agreements, where a full-time employee can be hired to do the work, and the employee's time can be divided across multiple organizations. The State Party Advancement Network is working on such a solution for state parties, but there are other sectors where this solution might apply - for example, among national committees like [DAGA](https://dems.ag/), [DASS](https://demsofstate.org/), etc.
