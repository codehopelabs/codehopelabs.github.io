This idea, described by [Kyle Roberts in his Business of Politics interview](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/11437477-tracking-the-spending-of-the-9-8-billion-midterm-elections-kyle-roberts-adimpact) at the 20:16 mark, is to build a platform for measuring ad impact. Specifically, the goal is to measure penetration to voters, so that it's easy to determine whether a given voter reached by a particular ad was also contacted by a pollster.

This idea dovetails closely with the idea for a [media voter file](https://codehopelabs.com/ideas/media-voter-file.html).
