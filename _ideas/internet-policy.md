We need to reform the way we think about Internet policy, and progressives need to develop proposals in this area. There are numerous issues important for reform:

* Reforming [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230). This Act absolves social media networks of the need to monitor content on their platforms. In light of the problems of online radicalization and the anti-democratic potential it carries, it may be wise to create some kind of standard framework for content monitoring.
* Privacy reform, such as a nationwide version of the California Consumer Protection Act or the General Data Protection Regulations of the EU.
* [CAN SPAM reform so that spam regulations apply to political communication](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1126), as Kenneth Pennington discusses in his Great Battlefield interview at the 58:40 mark.

At a high level, we need to be thinking about how we want the Internet to look from a positive perspective, to think about how the Internet can serve pro-social goals. [New_ Public](https://newpublic.org/) is doing great work along these lines, and there may be policy reforms that arise out of this work. The [Stanford Global Digital Policy Incubator](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/gdpi) also does work along these lines.
