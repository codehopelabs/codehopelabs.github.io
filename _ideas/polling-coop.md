A polling coop would be an organization with membership open to campaigns and organizations. This organization would consolidate polling data, both public and private, and share it across its member organizations. Such an organization could also share best practices for polling, and could help member organizations deal with problems like phone response rates. This idea is repurposed from [Adam Wise's Business of Politics interview](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/11865595-measuring-the-competitive-paid-media-landscape-adam-wise-national-media), at the 29:28 mark. One example of a polling coop in Democratic circles is [Majority Institute](https://majorityinstitute.com).
