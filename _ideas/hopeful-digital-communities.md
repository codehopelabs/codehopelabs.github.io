title: Hopeful digital communities
---

One of the big problems facing the progressive movement - and politics writ large - is the proliferation of cynical messaging, especially in scam tactics used in digital organizing. These tactics tend to depress fundraising and volunteer activity in the long run, but what is worse, they have an immediate negative impact on high-level messaging and policy. In simple terms, they tend to push progressives into messaging based on contrast rather than messaging based on a positive vision for the future.

We need to develop a strategy for building hopeful digital communities, which are more focused on a positive vision. Some of this work is already underway - email programs for Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Elizabeth Warren are well-regarded for their substantive content and positive tone. However, there is more that can be done.

We're particularly interested in tactics which build digital communities which are more relational than transactional in nature. In particular, these communities should have some or all of these characteristics:

* The tone of the community should feel hopeful, active, and oriented towards positive change.
* Individual members should be connected to each other via "horizontal organizing".
* Individual members should be able to "talk back" to organizers and interact with the community in a way that feels empowering.
* Individual members should be empowered to self-organize into sub-communities and to self-govern as much as possible.
* The community should manifest itself in the real world from time to time - e.g. via volunteer days, meetups, or other activities which promote face-to-face relationship.
* The community should engage in persuasion as well as mobilization. Organizers should seek to bring members on an ideological journey, as is done in traditional community organizing or union organizing.
* Members should look forward to the community and should want to bring their friends and family into it, because it is such a positive experience.

As noted, there is some precedence for similar kinds of communities - many of these ideas are borrowed from union organizing and traditional organizing communities. We believe they may be repurposed towards other forms of ideological organizing, such as religious organizing or organizing around broad cultural movements like LGBTQ rights. In fact, it is likely that these kinds of communities should not be employed in a campaign context at the outset; perhaps they should never be.

Our conjecture is that it is possible to build these communities as a way to promote ideological conversion, and to make the experience of participating in politics and public life more pleasant and even enjoyable. Although such ideas might not benefit campaign tactics directly, they are likely to improve participation and make campaigns more effective indirectly.
