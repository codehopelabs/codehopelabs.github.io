This idea was proposed by Dave Troy in [his Great Battlefield interview](http://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1099), at the 1:03:36 mark. The idea is to build expertise on a variety of topics, and then to provide that expertise as an interpretive framework for journalists charged with covering those topics. In cases where journalists have insufficient background, such an agency could provide much-needed context in order to properly frame an issue. Troy gives the example of the war in Ukraine through the lens of the Treaty of Westphalia, but a similar approach could work for numerous other issues or personalities.
