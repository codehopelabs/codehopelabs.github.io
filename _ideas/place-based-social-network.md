title: Place-based social network
---

A place-based social network is similar to Facebook or Twitter in functionality, but is focused on curating the civic experience of a relatively small locality such as a city or neighborhood. It differs from place-based groups on larger social networks in that the entire experience is organized around a particular locality.

There is such a social network in the form of NextDoor; however, as critiqued by Pete Davis, this social network is primarily focused on complaints and crime remediation, rather than any kind of civic organizing or larger civic life. [Davis describes the process of building a place-based social network](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1138) in some detail in his Great Battlefield episode at the 9:17 mark. He describes the idea as something akin to a "Wordpress install" for a town that could be installed to a local server, maintained by a civic organization like a library. The key to his idea is that local communities should be akin to a Redit forum, where everyone has the same feed, and there should be maximal public space.

[Ethan Zuckerman describes a related concept for an online town square](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/997) in his Great Battlefield episode, at the 41:31 mark. This project is described in some detail at the [Initiative for Public Infrastructure](https://publicinfrastructure.org/) as well.
