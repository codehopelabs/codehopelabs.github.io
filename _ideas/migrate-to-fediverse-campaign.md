David Slifka proposed a [campaign to encourage mass migration to the fediverse](https://slifka.substack.com/p/freedom-day-is-coming), whether on Mastodon or some other service. The purpose of this campaign is to break the grip that Twitter has on public discourse - it would also have an additional benefit of improving the experience many people have on social media. The campaign would be part-engineering work, part-organizing campaign, and would focus on leveraging the "whirlwind moment" caused by turbulence on Twitter in order to change the way we produce and consumer social media.
