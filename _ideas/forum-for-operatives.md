Democratic and progressive operatives need a broad-based forum where they can discuss common problems, share best practices, and otherwise interact freely. Currently, there are many small communities which focus on a slice of this space, often by targeting a specific job function. For example, the [Code Hope Labs slack](https://forms.gle/HTpbc9rgtuBUSXi18) focuses on operatives in the software and progressive tech space. However, a more broad-based forum that is open to any operative would help promote better knowledge sharing and ideation.

This idea was developed by Matthew Duell.
