State legislators are often underfunded. Providing progressive state legislators with tools they need to be more effective could have outsize impacts on legislation:

* Tools like [Legidash](https://democracyfund.org/grant/popvox-legidash-fund/), for tracking legislative calendars, events in and around the capitol building, etc.
* Constituent services trackers, such as the idea [Drew Ryun described in his Business of Politics interview](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/10586826-building-campaign-software-that-works-for-everyone-drew-ryun-campaign-sidekick) at the 27:51 mark.
* Resources similar to those offered by the [State Information Exchange](https://stateinnovation.org/), such as strategy sessions, customized research, and issue trainings.

Similar ideas apply to other legislative bodies, especially city councils in small- to mid-size cities.
