The "campaign in a box" idea is the notion that it's possible to pull together all of the resources needed to run a certain kind of campaign - for example, a state house campaign in Michigan - in an easily-repeatable way. The resources in question could be legal, logistical, technological, and otherwise. For example, a campaign in a box might include:

* Filing papers
* Relationships with local printers to produce campaign literature
* A campaign website and social media account
* ... and numerous other resources

This idea has been explored and tried many times and in different forms, but has never proved seriously viable. [Keith Mestrich and Nathaniel Pearlman discuss the campaign-in-a-box concept](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/1020) in Keith's Great Battlefield interview, at the 34:02 mark.
