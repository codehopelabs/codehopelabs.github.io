title: Digital metrics for progress
---

Digital metrics are not great - stats like number of likes, followers, replies, etc., do not always convey nuance in a given conversation. For example, it's possible to have a Facebook post with lots of comments - which are all really negative or depict some very strong emotions. Moreover, it's difficult to aggregate stats across a variety of social media sites and campaigns. Is it possible to create some kind of ready-made "dashboard" which enables us to see at a glance how a given conversation is moving, who is "winning" an issue and who is "losing", what kind of messages resonate and which don't?

There's a ton of prior art here, so part of this idea may already be sovled! Credit to [Beth Becker's interview on Great Battlefield](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/715) for this idea.
