title: Email tracking pixel
---

This idea, taken from [Ian Hines's Business of Politics interview](https://podcast.startupcaucus.com/1833138/11825937-conversation-the-state-of-online-campaign-fundraising) at the 25:27 mark, is to insert a Facebook tracking pixel into HTML emails. By doing so, digital organizers can target their supporters on Facebook based on their email viewing activity. There is some question as to technical feasibility of this approach, sinnce most Facebook pixels use Javascript, but it appears that [it is possible to insert an image-only pixel](https://litmus.com/community/discussions/6279-facebook-tracking-pixel-in-html-email).
