Finding a good office space in the midst of a campaign can be pretty difficult. Resourcing it with furniture, internet access, office supplies, etc., is an additional headache. Is it possible to create a service that simplifies this problem as much as possible, offering turn-key "spin-up/spin-down" services for campaigns? Can such a service turn these offices around to community organizing groups during "off" cycles for an additional boost?
