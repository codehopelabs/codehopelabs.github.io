title: Partisanship Campaign
---

Voters tend to vote in partisan fashion, with ticket-splitting on the decline and even most self-declared independents acting, in practice, as partisans of one party or another. Therefore, instead of focusing our efforts on supporting one candidate or another, we should focus on pushing voters into the Democratic party.

This idea was developed by Hal Malchow in an opinion piece in The Hill in September 2021, about [partisanship in the Democratic Party's campaign strategy](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/573974-how-the-democratic-partys-campaign-strategy-is-failing-america/). He further discussed it on the [Great Battlefield podcast in August 2021](https://www.resistancedashboard.com/node/914).
