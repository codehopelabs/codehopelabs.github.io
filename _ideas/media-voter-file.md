title: Media Voter File
---

As digital media like connected TV offers better and better data about viewing patterns, it is increasingly easy to target ads at individual voters. In cases where targeting is not possible, it is sometimes possible to determine which voters viewed an individual ad *post hoc*.

The idea of a media voter file is to integrate this data into a voter file, in the same way that individual canvassing records are integrated today. In just the same way that door knocks and phone calls are tracked in VAN today, it is possible in some cases to track ad views at an individual level. Doing so would consequently facilitate more efficient use of ad dollars, so that campaigns could more readily direct ad dollars towards high-priority targets.
