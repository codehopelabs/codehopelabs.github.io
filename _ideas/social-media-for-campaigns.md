title: Social Media for Campaigns
---

How can we create small social media networks for campaign professionals and volunteers? How can we make it easy for staff to readily communicate with one another and/or their volunteers? These problems affect all kinds of campaigns, and solving them helps enable things like distributed canvassing and peer-to-peer canvassing.

Also - how do we stay in touch after a campaign is over? How do we retain email addresses once "jane@barackobama.com" has been decommissioned because the campaign is over? How can campaigns quickly find high-quality professionals who might be able to help them out?

There is some prior art here - National Field attempted to create just such a tool in the aftermath of the Obama campaign. However, the tool suffered from lack of adoption and has since been shuttered. It was also not really "Slack-enabled". What can we do to upgrade such tools and make it easy to communicate within a campaign, with the latest suite of tools available?
