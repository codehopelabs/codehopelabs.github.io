This page describes an experiment conducted with ChatGPT. The intent is to determine how suitable ChatGPT is for political targeting. In this experiment, we drafted an email about health care policy for three different localities with very different political sensibilities: Cambridge, MA; St. Louis, MO; and Springfield, MO. The first is a famously radical city; the second is a liberal city surrounded by moderate suburbs; the last is a well-known conservative city, sometimes called the "capital of the Bible Belt." The experiment sought to determine whether or not ChatGPT would leverage these political differences to tailor each email separately - for example, promoting Medicare for All in the Cambridge email while promoting faith-based alternatives in the Springfield email. It also sought to determine whether the email would reference news of local note - e.g., hospital closures or recent political decisions such as the passage of 2020 Missouri Amendment 2 to expand Medicaid.

From the results below, it's clear that the model did not make use of this context. The three emails are nearly identical, and it appears that the model did little more than insert the name of the city in question into a very generic email.

Subject: Proposed Health Care Policy for Cambridge, Massachusetts Residents

Dear Cambridge Resident,

I hope this email finds you well. As a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, you are likely aware of the importance of having access to quality health care. With the rising costs of medical care and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that we work together to ensure that all residents have access to the care they need.

To this end, I am proposing a new health care policy for Cambridge residents that will provide increased access to affordable health care services. The policy will focus on the following key areas:

    Affordable Health Insurance: One of the biggest barriers to accessing health care is the cost of health insurance. Our policy will aim to make health insurance more affordable for all residents, regardless of income. We will explore options such as expanding Medicaid eligibility, offering subsidies for those who cannot afford insurance, and working with private insurers to negotiate lower rates for Cambridge residents.

    Telemedicine: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telemedicine, which allows patients to consult with doctors and other healthcare providers remotely. Our policy will promote the use of telemedicine to make it easier and more convenient for residents to access medical care. This will be especially beneficial for those who are unable to travel to medical facilities or have mobility issues.

    Community Health Centers: Community health centers play a vital role in providing primary care services to underserved communities. Our policy will support the expansion of community health centers in Cambridge to provide affordable, accessible healthcare services to residents.

    Mental Health Services: Mental health is an important aspect of overall health and wellbeing. Our policy will prioritize access to mental health services for all residents, including those with low income or limited access to resources.

    Health Education: Health education is an important component of preventive healthcare. Our policy will focus on providing residents with information and resources to help them make informed decisions about their health and wellbeing.

We believe that these initiatives will go a long way towards improving the health and wellbeing of Cambridge residents. We welcome your feedback and input as we work to finalize this policy.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
