title: Sample LLM Experimentation Policy
---

The policy below is intended to be used within cause-based organizations which wish to encourage the experimental use of ChatGPT or other LLMs within their organizations. It is intended to be repurposed, expanded, and otherwise modified as needed. Many thoughtful individuals interested in the use of LLMs for politics contributed to this text, but improvements are of course always possible.

Other resources related to this one are noted below, you may want to consult these as well.

The sample policy is released under the MIT License as noted below.

## Sample policy

It's clear that ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) like Bard may well have a tremendous impact on our future. We encourage you to experiment with these tools! However, please stick to some key guidelines to avoid any potential harm to our organization or the people we serve:

1. We wish to encourage your use of LLMs for experimental purposes, and to discover novel innovations which may propel our organization forward. This policy is meant to promote that kind of usage, and we welcome any feedback about it. In particular, we welcome feedback about the need for "ChatGPT Plus" licenses or similar resources if the reason is compelling.
2. Do not disclose sensitive proprietary material, such as strategic memos, lists of donors, or sensitive constituent data, to cloud-based LLMs like ChatGPT or Bard. It is too early to know whether these materials will be suitably protected, or if they may inadvertantly fall into the wrong hands. In particular, it is possible that data provided to ChatGPT or Bard may be included in a future release of these models.
3. When using the by-products of an LLM in your work, please properly cite it. (For example, "when I asked ChatGPT what the weather will be tomorrow, I got: ...".)
4. When using the by-products of an LLM in your work, you are ultimately responsible for those by-products. You should therefore verify any factual claims, check for logical and gramatical errors, etc.
5. Be cognizant that there are ethical concerns with the use of large LLMs for a variety of reasons. For example, ChatGPT has been criticized for being trained on racially-biased text, and fed data provided by exploitative labor practices. Think carefully about how such criticisms might reflect on our work.
6. Do not use ChatGPT or Bard for production-quality systems, especially at the free tier. We consider these systems to be potentially useful augmentations to our internal work rather than a mission-critical and resilient system.
7. Take care in adhering to the ChatGPT or Bard usage policies. In particular, note that large-scale use of ChatGPT for political purposes is forbidden. Unfortunately, the full meaning if this policy has not yet been made clear.
8. If you intend to use LLMs on an ongoing basis in some clearly-defined process, or if you intend to develop a program around LLMs, please report it to your manager.
9. Please share this policy with any vendors who may have access to sensitive orgnizational materials, and ensure that they do not share these materials with cloud-based LLMs.
10. This policy may be updated from time to time, and we will endeavor to keep you up to date as these changes are made. LLMs are developing very quickly, and it may well be necessary to update our policy corresponding to new developments.
